Preprocessing KTH source files
==============================

The kth_maps_preprocessing package comes with tools for turning the XML floorplan
descriptions as part of the dataset generated by KTH.

The dataset can be acquired here:
http://www.csc.kth.se/~aydemir/floorplans.html

For best use with this package, extract the contents of the tar ball to
a folder titled source_files within this package


## Generate Gazebo worlds
To generate Gazebo world files to use for simulation, run the following scripts:
   1. get_models.sh will generate gazebo models of the walls of the environment for all source files
   2. gen_world.sh will turn all models into a world file that can be directly loaded with Gazebo

## Generate ROS maps
To generate map files, run the get_maps.sh script. This will turn generate a map.pgm and map.yaml file
for each environment in the source_files directory.

## Generate maps and worlds
To generate the world files and the maps all at once, run the gen_all.sh script.




When using the dataset, be sure to cite the original work:
